1. Copy the data to be diagnosed into the excel file "Data". 
Make sure to respect the order of the dissolved gases: H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and C2H2. 
After the concentrations of the dissolved gases, enter the label of the samples by respecting the codification indicated.
2. Save the changes in the excel file "Data" and close.
3. Open the Matlab code of the method (Code_Hybrid_method_IEEE.m).
4. In the Matlab file of the method code, update the following information:
N : the number of samples (line 10)
n1 : the information of the reading of the H2 in the excel file (line 13)
n2 : the information of the reading of the CH4 in the excel file (line 14)
n3 : the information of the reading of the C2H6 in the excel file (line 15)
n4 : the information of the reading of the C2H4 in the excel file (line 16)
n5 : the information of the reading of the C2H2 in the excel file (line 17)
the information of the writing of the diagnostic results in the excel file (line 1342)
5. Run the code
